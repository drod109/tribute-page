            <h2>Bessie Coleman Earns Her Pilot's License</h2>
            <p>
              Bessie Coleman was the first African American woman to earn a
              pilot's license.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1920s, getting a pilot's license as a Black woman in the
              United States was impossible; so Colman moved to France to get her
              flying certification. On June 15, 1921, Coleman achieved her
              goal-making history as the first African American woman to earn a
              pilot's liense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coleman's example proved an inspiration for a number of pioneers
              in aeronautics and eventually astronautics, including John
              Robinson, Cornelius Coffey, Willa Brown, Janet Harmon Bragg,
              Robert H. Lawrence Jr., and Mae Jemison.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Coleman was born in Atlanta, Texas, to Susan and George coleman.
            George, who had Native American grandparents, would eventually
            return to the Cherokee Nation, leaving Susan to raise Coleman and
            her siblings alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1920, 27-year old Bessie Coleman, now living in segregated
            Chicago, was at a personal crossroads. She sought a life beyond her
            job of manicurist in beauty salons. When her brother, a World War I
            veteran, taunted her about her future with stories of French women
            flyers she replied,
            <q>That's it... You just called it for me!</q> She was determine to
            become a pilot. But in the United States, Black men were not welcome
            n aviation, let alone Black women.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfazed after white pilots refused to give her instruction, Coleman
            sought advice from Robert Abbot, publisher of the influential Black
            newspaper the Chicago Defender, and a constant advocate for the
            inclusion of Black people in American Society. Sensing her
            commitment, and the resulting publicity if she succeeded, Abbot
            advised Coleman to learn French and seek training in France where
            Black people experience more respect and opportunity than they did
            in the United States.

            <h2>Her Career Begins</h2>
            <p>
              She was accepted by the Caudron Brothers School of Aviation, a
              well-respected flight school run by the renowned builders of World
              War I aircraft, and traveled to France to purse her goal. Flying
              the Nieuport 82 dual-controlled trainer, she earned her pilot’s
              license – the first African American woman to do so. Not only
              that, she earned her license in just seven months.
            </p>
            <p>
              She quickly determined she needed more training to safely perform
              barnstorming stunts and someday operate her own flight school. She
              returned to Europe in early 1922 and trained for two months in
              France and ten weeks in Berlin, Germany, where she flew with
              German military aces. When she returned again to the United
              States, Black and white newspaper reporters greeted her in New
              York City and hailed her accomplishment.

        <h3>
          On September 3, 1922, in a borrowed Curtiss JN-4D Jenny at Curtiss
          Field on Long Island, Bessie Coleman made the first public flight by a
          Black woman in the United States.
        </h3>
        <p>
          She followed it with a flight in Memphis, Tennessee, and then a
          triumphant exhibition before the friendly, integrated crowd of 2,000
          at Checkerboard Field in Chicago on October 15. However, subsequent
          flights, film opportunities, and managers in Chicago did not pan out.
          Without film and flying opportunities, Coleman considered advertising.
          In early 1923, she went to California to pursue an advertising venture
          with Coast Tire and Rubber of Oakland. Her hope was to break into
          barnstorming—one of the few jobs in aviation at this time.

            <p>
              On April 30, 1926, Coleman and her mechanic went up for a practice
              flight before an upcoming performance. Wills piloted the plane as
              Coleman surveyed the ground for a suitable parachute landing site.
              To do so she did not buckle her seat belt. Soon tragedy struck.
              Cruising at 3,500 feet, the biplane accelerated and then suddenly
              went into a nosedive, tailspin and flipped over. Coleman was
              thrown from the aircraft and plunged to her death. Wills crashed
              with the plane and was also killed.

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            Coleman would not live long enough to establish a school for young
            black aviators, but her pioneering achievements served as an
            inspiration for a generation of African-American men and women.
            "Because of Bessie Coleman," wrote Lieutenant William J. Powell in
            Black Wings (1934), dedicated to Coleman, "we have overcome that
            which was worse than racial barriers. We have overcome the barriers
            within ourselves and dared to dream. Powell served in a segregated
            unit during World War I, and tirelessly promoted the cause of black
            aviation through his book, his journals, and the Bessie Coleman Aero
            Club, which he founded in 1929.

            <p>
              While Coleman did not achieve her dream of opening a flying
              school, her brief career inspired many others to pursue their
              dreams. Pictured is the Bessie Coleman Aero Club, organized by
              William J. Powell (far right), a successful owner of several
              automobile service stations in Chicago, to promote aviation
              awareness in the black community. Both men and women were welcome
              to apply.
