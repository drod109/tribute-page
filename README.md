## My process

I took my inspiration from [National Air and Space Museum | Bessie Coleman](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/bessie-coleman) page.
Now that I have the design pattern I will take a screenshot and mock up where I believe either flex or grid items need to be pladed. Once that I have done that I will be being to write a semantic html structure before the styling process is completed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
